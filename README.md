This script takes in two images: one image showing the red nematic lines and one image containing XY resolution information. Both based upon the same raw image. The script allows the user to draw two regions-of-interest (ROIs), thereby dividing the nematic lines into two groups. The script outputs one histogram showing the lengths of the nematic lines inside each group (ROI), and two polar histograms illustrating the the angle of the nematic lines inside each ROI.
