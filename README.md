This script takes two images as input: one image showing the red nematic lines and one image containing XY resolution information. Both input images are based on the same original image. The script allows the user to draw two regions of interest (ROIs), thereby dividing the nematic lines into two groups. The script outputs one histogram showing the lengths of the nematic lines inside each ROI and two polar histograms illustrating the angle of the nematic lines inside each ROI.
